<p>Breaking Form/Making Books: Literary Experimentation in the US after 1800, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, Visiting Assistant Professor, 2019, 1 section. This course consisted of three five-week units based on the study of single authors who were considered innovators in their own time: Walt Whitman, Langston Hughes, and Ronald Johnson. Each unit began with a session working with rare editions of the authors’ works in the university’s special collections. Student projects were based on the study of these archived materials.</p>
<p>Inhabiting an American Self, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, Visiting Assistant Professor, 2018, 1 section. This course explores concepts of selfhood and citizenship from literary and ethical perspectives in texts by Frederick Douglass, James Baldwin, Claudia Rankine, Martha Roberts, Leyli Long Soldier, and Joy Harjo. Theoretical frames for our discussions range from Saidiya Hartman’s reading of Douglass to Judith Butler’s concept of performativity.</p>

This course is an introduction to the study of poetry as a genre that includes a variety of sub-divisions, such as prose poetry, song, and electronic texts. Students experiment with a variety of critical modes that allow them to conduct analysis through close reading, try popular critical genres (the book review), and branch out into interdisciplinary inquiries.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald and Hurston, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, Visiting Assistant Professor, 2018, 1 section. This course compares and contrasts F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby and Tender Is the Night with Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God and Moses, Man of the Mountain. Discussions and written assignments focus on the multiple facets of American Modernism, as well as treatments of language, race and gender in the novels of both authors.</p>
<p>American Poetry, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, Visiting Assistant Professor, 2018/19, 2 sections. This course begins with the question: “What is American about American poetry?” Class discussions and written assignments explore this question alongside readings of Anne Bradstreet, Phyllis Wheatley, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, William Carlos Williams, Langston Hughes, Adrienne Rich, and others. Because this class is a survey, it emphasizes the heterogeneity of voices and traditions in American poetry.</p>
<p>Poe &amp; His World, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, Visiting Assistant Professor, 2017, 1 section. This course tracks the evolution of Edgar Allan Poe’s career as a writer, from the early self-published books of poetry through his years as a magazine editor and widely circulated writer of tales and literary criticism.

<p>Science Fiction: Dystopias, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, Visiting Assistant Professor, 2016, 1 section. This course begins with classics (Brave New World and 1984) and ends with recent works that blur the boundary between genre literature and literary fiction (Parable of the Sower and The Circle). Students in this class are asked to think historically about why dystopian fictions continue to speak to our present moment.</p>
<p>Reading and Writing about the Novel, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, Visiting Assistant Professor, 2016, 1 section. This first-year course for English majors introduces students to the study of the novel in history and theory.

<p>Documentary Poetics: Theories and Practices from Whitman to Goldsmith, Technische Universität Dortmund, Germany, Instructor, 2014/2015, 2 sections. In this course on literature from the late nineteenth through the twenty-first century, students develop research projects based on texts that attempts to affect immediate contact with a historical event and that respond to new media of their period, such as photography and sound recording.</p>
